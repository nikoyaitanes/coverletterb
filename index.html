      <h2 id="exp"> My past experience relevant to this position: </h2>
<p> 
For three years, I worked on campus at the Center for Aging and Disability Research (BU CADER). I began as a Research Assistant but was quickly promoted to Marketing Coordinator. As Marketing Coordinator, I spearheaded all of the email marketing campaigns for over 25,000 active clients. I overhauled the emails and made them mobile responsive, which resulted in an increase in opens by +30%. I led the content schedule and scheduled campaigns up to six months in advance. When the company expanded, I managed all the email campaigns for the new subdivision (Professional Education Programs).  I also was a Design Strategist and Marketing Manager for Restore Body Balance. At this position, I designed digital, video and print advertisements, including the covers and typography for my bossâ€™ book and its accompanying journal. I tracked campaign analytics and made actionable objectives from them. I also completed several digital and social media internships, including a social marketing internship at Live Nation Entertainment in Beverly Hills, where scheduling campaigns and data analytics played large roles.</p>
